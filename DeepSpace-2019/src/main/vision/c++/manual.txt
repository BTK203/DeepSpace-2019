FRC team 3695 vision manual

-------------------------------------------------------------

This file goes over how to work with the code and what certain parts of it are and do. 
NOTE: All vision code in this folder is written in C++, and assumes that the image captured from the video stream is already preprocessed.

---------------
I. The Settings
---------------

All settings for the program are located in "Settings.h".

 - DEBUG              : Option to run the program in debugging mode. In this mode, postprocessed image is displayed and a GUI is provided.
 - USE_IMAGE          : Option to use image included in folder (target_3.jpg). This is for developing outside of the room.
                    
 - CAMERA_RESOLUTION_X: The camera resolution width. This must match that of the JeVois configuration, or we will not get the right image.
 - CAMERA_RESOLUTION_Y: The camera resolution height. This also must match the resolution height of the JeVois camera.

 - KNOWN_HEIGHT       : The height of ONE of the rectangular pieces of the target in inches. In our case the height is 5.5 inches tall. This should not change.
 - FOCAL_HEIGHT       : The percieved focal height of the target from 24 inches. You should get this value from the calibrator.

 - ASPECT_RATIO       : The aspect ratio of ONE side of the target. For the DeepSpace challenge, it is somewhere around .3 (2in / 5.5in)
 - ASPECT_RATIO_ERROR : The amount of deviation from the aspect ratio that is allowed for a contour to pass
                    
 - AREA               : The area of the contour. This will usually be a big number with a big range of error. This is simply to root out noise.
 - AREA_ERROR         : The amount of deviation from the area that is allowed.

 - LEFT_ANGLE         : The angle of the leftmost contour of the target. Probably will be negative (thanks opencv!). Use Calibrate.py in the python folder to get the best angle
 - RIGHT_ANGLE        : The angle of the righmost contour of the target. Again, just use the calibration program in the python folder.
 - ANGLE_ERROR        : The amount of deviation from the angle that is allowed for a contour to pass.
                    
 - DISTANCE           : The distance in inches between the centers of the target.
 - DISTANCE_ERROR     : The amount of deviation the distance between the contours can be.

II. Compiling
-------------

To compile the code, use the below command. Make sure you are in the vision/c++ directory. gcc can also be used in place of g++.
g++ -o Main Main.cpp Vision.h PostProcessor.cpp Util.cpp PairData.cpp Settings.h Settings.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
run program with: ./Main

To compile the calibration program, change into the vision/c++/calibration directory and use below command. 
g++ -o Main Main.cpp Calibration.h Calibration.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv gtk+-2.0`
run program with: ./Main
